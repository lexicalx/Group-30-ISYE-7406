Our project applies advanced Regression techniques to predict the final price of each home from the Ames Housing dataset, compiled by Dean De Cock, a high-dimensional data set with 79 predicting variables. We will be evaluating variable selection and modeling methods.

The goal of this analysis is to predict the sales price for each house. The data is pre-split into train and test data sets so users may compare their results against approaches from other teams.
